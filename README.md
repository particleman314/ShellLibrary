# bci-shell

The Shell Library Component Framework (SLCF) are a set of libraries simplifying scripting and providing a tested environment for rapid development.  Many different library components exist and as such interdependencies are managed across components.  Some libraries are still under development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

[TBD]

## Running Tests

The library itself is tested against >2500 tests designed to touch all functionality within each library.  Furthermore, assertion style functions exist which can be imported into other projects to enhance the develop-test-debug cycle.

The current list of library components are...

* argparsing
* assertions
* base_logging
* base_machinemgt
* base_setup
* cmd_interface
* cmdmgt
* compression
* constants
* debugging
* emailmgt
* execaching
* file_assertions
* filemgt
* hashmaps
* inimgt
* jsonmgt -- [ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ]
* list
* logging
* machinemgt
* network_assertions
* networkmgt
* newscriptgen
* numerics
* paramfilemgt
* parammgt
* passwordmgt
* pkgmgt
* processmgt
* queue
* rest -- [ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ]
* set_operations
* sshmgt
* stack
* stringmgt
* teamcity
